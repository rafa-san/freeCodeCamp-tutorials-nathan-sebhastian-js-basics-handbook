  <h1>Learn JavaScript for Beginners â€“ JS Basics Handbook</h1>

  <h2>1 - JavaScript Introduction</h2>

  <h3>Why learn JavaScript?</h3>
  <p>There are 4 good reasons why you need to learn and deeply understand JavaScript:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript is the only language that works in the browser</li>
    <li>It's fairly easy to learn (but hard to master)</li>
    <li>It's an essential language for making web applications</li>
    <li>There are many career opportunities for JavaScript devs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4 - Time to Say Hello World!</h2>
  <p>For now, just remember that the console.log() keyword is used to print things to the console.</p>

  <h2>7 - JavaScript Basic Data Types</h2>
  <p>Data Types are simply definitions for different types of data known to a programming language.</p>
  <p>In this section, you're going to learn basic data types that JavaScript knows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Strings</li>
    <li>Numbers</li>
    <li>Booleans</li>
    <li>Null</li>
    <li>Undefined</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Undefined in JavaScript</h3>
  <p>Undefined is a data type in JavaScript used to represent a variable that hasn't been assigned any value yet.</p>
  <p>Anytime you declared a variable without assigning any value, the undefined value will be assigned to that variable.</p>

  <h3>Null in JavaScript</h3>
  <p>The null value is a special data type that represents an empty or unknown value. Here's how you assign a variable as null:</p>
  <code>let first_name = null;</code>
  <p>The code above means that the value of first_name is empty or unknown.</p>
  <p>Both undefined and null are values that represent nothing, and other programming languages usually only have one, and that is null.</p>
  <p>In JavaScript, the undefined value is reserved as the default value when a variable is declared, while null means you intentionally assign an "empty" value for the variable.</p>
  <p>For now, just keep in mind that JavaScript treats undefined as the "default" empty value and null as the "intentional" empty value.</p>

  <h2>8 - Type conversion and coercion</h2>
  <p>Changing the data from one type to another is also known as type conversion or type casting. There are 3 functions frequently used to do type conversion:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Number()</li>
    <li>String()</li>
    <li>Boolean()</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As their name implies, these type conversion functions will attempt to convert any value you specified inside the parentheses to the type of the same name.</p>

  <h3>Type coercion</h3>
  <p>In JavaScript, type coercion is a process where a value of one type is implicitly converted into another type.</p>
  <p>This is automatically done by JavaScript so that your code won't cause an error. But as you'll see in this section, type coercion can actually cause undesired behavior in the program.</p>

  <h2>9 - Operators in JavaScript</h2>

  <h3>The comparison operators</h3>
  <p>JavaScript also has two versions of each comparison operator: loose and strict.</p>
  <p>In strict mode, JavaScript will compare the types without performing a type coercion.</p>
  <code>console.log("9" == 9); // true</code> <br>
  <code>console.log("9" === 9); // false</code>

  <h2>11 - Control Flows (Conditionals) in JavaScript</h2>
  <p>Control flow is a feature in a programming language that allows you to selectively run specific code based on the different conditions that may arise.</p>
  <p>Using control flows allows you to define multiple paths a program can take based on the conditions present in your program.</p>
  <p>There are two types of control flows commonly used in JavaScript: conditionals and loops.</p>

  <h3>The switch statement body</h3>
  <p>You need to remember the differences between the if and case evaluations:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>if block will be executed when the test condition evaluates to true</li>
    <li>case block will be executed when the test condition exactly matches the given switch argument</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>12 - Control Flows (Loops) in JavaScript</h2>
  <p>A Loop statement is another category of control flow statement used to execute a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.</p>

  <h3>When to use a for loop</h3>
  <p>The for loop is useful when you know how many times you need to execute a repetitive task.</p>

  <h3>When to use a while loop</h3>
  <p>An easy way to know when you should use while is when you don't know how many times you need to execute the code.</p>

  <h2>13 - Functions in JavaScript</h2>
  <p>A function is simply a section (or a block) of code that's written to perform a specific task.</p>
  <p>For example, the type casting function String() is used to convert data of another type to a string.</p>
  <p>The console.log() and various array methods we've learned in previous chapters are also functions. But because these functions are called from an object, they are called methods.</p>
  <p>You'll learn more about methods later in Chapter 14. For now, just know that a function and a method are essentially the same, except that a method is called from an object.</p>
  <p>Besides the built-in functions provided by JavaScript, you can also create your own function.</p>

  <h3>The rest parameter</h3>
  <p>The rest parameter is a parameter that can accept any number of data as its arguments. The arguments will be stored as an array.</p>
  <p>You can define a rest parameter in the function header by adding triple dots ... before the parameter name.</p>
